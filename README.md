## Objective of the Project 
The objective of this project is to analyse, draw insights, design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will draw insights and visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping the company understand the sales performance over time and making data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement 1: KPIâ€™s
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the company's sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

### 1.Sales Overview:
Below are the new measures that was created using Power BI DAX function

Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales shows us the total sales from first year to last date

Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales shows us the total sales from first month to last

Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales shows us the the total sales growth over the year

Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales shows us the percentage difference in sales from previous year

### 2. Average Price Analysis:
YTD Average Price shows us the average sales from first year to last date

MTD Average Price shows us the average sales from first month to last

YOY Growth in Average Price Sales shows us the the total sales growth over the year

Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price shows us the percentage difference in sales from previous year

### 3. Cars Sold Metrics:
YTD Cars Sold shows us the tatal number of cars sold from first year to last date

MTD Cars Sold shows us the total number of cars sold from first month to last

YOY Growth in Cars Sold shows us the the total number of cars sales growth over the year

Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold shows us the percentage difference of cars sold from previous year

## Problem Statement 2: Charts 

###  1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend: 
Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis represent weeks, and the Y-axis shows the total sales amount.
        
###  2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style:
This chart visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.

###  3. YTD Total Sales by Color:
I presented the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales using a pie chart.

###  4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:
I showcased the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

### 5.  Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form:
I provided a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid is showcasing the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

### 6.  Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information:
I created a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc. 


## Data Modeling 
The data i retreived from the company had only one table but for the efficiency of this task, i extracted data from the "Date Column" from the original data and formed a second table named "Calender Table" and with the new table, i was able to mmodel and establish relationship between the original table and the new table by connecting the two different dates.

## Insights and Summary 
1. From the information our chart is presenting, we can see that the comapny has made sales increase of 19.73 percent from previous years with total 262 thousand vehicles sold. It's a good move and i can say that the company is doing pretty well.
2. We can also notice that the company made a hooping 70.8 million from the previous year to date which is 23.6 percent in total.
3. I also discovered from our analysis that we have more people patronizing "White Pale" coloured vehicle more than we have people patronizing other colours.
